# Compiled languages
Examples are:
- C
- Go

Advantage:
- execution speed!
- since the languages are converted directly into machine code, they run significantly faster and more efficiently than interpreted languages

Disadvantage:
- in order to run a program written in a compiled language, you need to first manually compile it
  - it's an extra step to run a program, and while you debug the program, you would need to recompile the program each time you want to test your new changes
- compiled languages are not platform-independent, as the compiled machine code is specific to the machine that is executing it.

# Interpreted languages
Examples are:
- Ruby
- Python

Advantage:
- Do not require machine code in order to execute the program.
- platform independence
- dynamic typing
- smaller executable program size

Disadvantage:
- it takes more time to execute the program, since the interpreter needs to run the program line by line
