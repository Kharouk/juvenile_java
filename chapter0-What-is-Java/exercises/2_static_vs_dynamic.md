## Dynamic Typing
- performs type checking at runtime
- This means languages (like Groovy) can compile even if they contain errors that will prevent the script from running properly
- not required to declare data types of your variables
- are more flexible and can save you time and space when writing scripts
  - Can lead to issues at runtime when the lax rules make it harder to detect potential overwriting errors

## Static Typing
- performs type checking at compile time.
- if a statically typed language like Java contains errors, it will fail to compile until the errors have been fixed. 
- requires you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them
